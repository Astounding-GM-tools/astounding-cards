## The Point

**Stats are flexible and optional.** They should match the content:

- RPG → Power, Defense, Magic (1-20)
- Pokemon → HP, Attack, Speed (1-100)
- Recipes → **Ingredients as stats!** "Pasta (g): 400", "Garlic cloves: 4"
- Recipes (general) → Time, Difficulty, Servings
- Movies → Rating, Runtime, Year
- People → Charisma, Influence, Fame
- Exercises → Intensity, Duration, Calories
- Some cards might need NO stats at all!

**Traits are terse and mostly private:**

- **Only ONE trait is public** (visible to all)
- **Descriptions are BRIEF** - 5-10 words max, not full sentences
- RPG → "Fire Resistant" - "Immune to flame damage"
- Celebrities → "Awkward in Interviews" - "Fumbles under pressure"
- Recipes → "Crowd Pleaser" - "Everyone requests this"
- Exercises → "Core-Focused" - "Targets abs and obliques"

**Avoid repetition:**

- Don't repeat information from the main description in traits/stats
- Expand on topics mentioned in the description instead
- Each section should add NEW information

**The system is universal. Let users be creative!**
