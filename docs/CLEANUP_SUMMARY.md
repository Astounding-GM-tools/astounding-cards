# Cleanup Summary

## What We Cleaned Up

After implementing the Canon Update pattern across the codebase, we performed a comprehensive cleanup to remove obsolete code and dependencies.

### Files Removed
- `src/lib/stores/deckContext.ts` - Old context-based update system, replaced by Canon Update pattern
- `src/lib/utils/debounce.ts` - No longer used after moving to immediate updates with loading states

### Functions Removed
- `updateCardProperty()` from `src/lib/db.ts` - Old database update function, replaced by `putDeck()` with Canon Update pattern
- Backward compatibility types from `src/lib/types.ts`:
  - `Character` type alias
  - `CharacterDeck` type alias
  - `validateCharacter` function alias
  - `isCharacter` function alias
  - `isCharacterDeck` function alias

### Imports Cleaned Up
- Removed unused `debounce` import from `CardFront.svelte`
- Removed `getDeckContext` and `createDeckContext` imports from components
- Cleaned up unused `onUpdate` prop from `ShareDialog` in main page

### Code Improvements
- Fixed theme preview images in `ThemeSelect.svelte` to use correct `/portraits/` paths
- Removed rollback comment that was no longer applicable
- Removed empty `onUpdate` callback prop from ShareDialog usage

## Canon Update Pattern Benefits

The cleanup was made possible by our successful implementation of the Canon Update pattern, which provides:

1. **Consistent Updates**: All state changes go through the same atomic database-first update flow
2. **Better UX**: Loading states provide clear feedback during updates
3. **Simplified Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with toast notifications
4. **Reduced Complexity**: No more optimistic updates, rollbacks, or race conditions
5. **Maintainability**: Single update pattern across all components

## Files Updated
- `src/lib/components/ui/ThemeSelect.svelte` - Fixed theme preview images
- `src/lib/components/dialogs/ShareDialog.svelte` - Converted to Canon Update pattern
- `src/routes/+page.svelte` - Removed deckContext creation and unused props
- `src/lib/stores/deck.ts` - Removed rollback comment
- `src/lib/db.ts` - Removed obsolete `updateCardProperty` function
- `src/lib/types.ts` - Removed migration compatibility types

## Result

The codebase is now cleaner, more consistent, and easier to maintain. All components use the same Canon Update pattern for state management, providing a better developer experience and more reliable user experience.
