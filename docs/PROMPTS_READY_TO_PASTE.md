## ⚠️ Important: AI Avoids Real Names

The AI is configured to **avoid real people's names and brand names** to prevent image generation failures:

- Real celebrities/politicians → Creative fictional alternatives ("The Orange Rage-King")
- Real brands → Made-up companies ("MegaCorp")
- Fictional characters (Gandalf, Sherlock) → ✅ Allowed!

This ensures image generation works smoothly. The prompts below already include this guidance.
