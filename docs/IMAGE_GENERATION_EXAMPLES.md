# Image Generation Examples

## Overview

The image generation system adapts to ANY content type, not just character portraits. This document shows examples of appropriate image styles for different deck types.

## Composition Styles by Content Type

### 1. Characters, Creatures, People

**Style:** Portrait orientation, centered subject
**Example:** "Norwegian celebrities as Pokemon"

- **Prompt focus:** Person in Pokemon-style art, centered composition, capturing their personality
- **Framing:** Upper body or full body portrait, character looking at viewer or in action pose
- **Background:** Simple, thematic, doesn't distract from subject

### 2. Objects, Items, Equipment

**Style:** Product shot, hero lighting
**Example:** "Cyberpunk Street Samurai Gear"

- **Prompt focus:** The item itself, clearly visible, professional presentation
- **Framing:** 3/4 angle or straight-on view showing key features
- **Background:** Minimal or contextual (workbench, display case)

### 3. Food & Recipes

**Style:** Food photography, overhead or angled
**Example:** "5-Ingredient Pasta Recipes"

- **Prompt focus:** The finished dish, appetizing presentation
- **Framing:** Overhead (flat lay) or 45-degree angle, plated beautifully
- **Background:** Clean surface, perhaps key ingredients visible around the dish
- **NOT:** Don't show ingredient lists or cooking steps - show the delicious result!

### 4. Locations, Places, Scenes

**Style:** Establishing shot, environmental
**Example:** "Travel: Must-See Tokyo Spots"

- **Prompt focus:** The location itself, capturing atmosphere and key features
- **Framing:** Wide or medium shot showing the space
- **Background:** IS the subject - make it compelling

### 5. Concepts, Ideas, Abstractions

**Style:** Metaphorical, symbolic
**Example:** "Programming Design Patterns"

- **Prompt focus:** Visual metaphor representing the concept
- **Framing:** Abstract composition, symbol-focused
- **Background:** Minimal, letting the metaphor speak
- **Example:** Factory Pattern → literal factory with gears and assembly lines

### 6. Exercises, Fitness

**Style:** Action demonstration, clean background
**Example:** "Bodyweight Exercises: No Equipment"

- **Prompt focus:** Person performing the exercise, proper form visible
- **Framing:** Full body or targeted body part, showing movement
- **Background:** Minimal, neutral, focus on form

### 7. Educational, Reference

**Style:** Diagram-like but artistic
**Example:** "Spanish Irregular Verbs Flashcards"

- **Prompt focus:** Visual representation of the concept
- **Framing:** Clear, uncluttered, educational but beautiful
- **Background:** Minimal
- **Example:** Verb conjugation → tree branching structure with colorful leaves

### 8. Collections, Media

**Style:** Still life, artistic arrangement
**Example:** "My Vinyl Collection"

- **Prompt focus:** The album cover or record itself
- **Framing:** Slightly angled, showing texture and details
- **Background:** Vintage feel, perhaps turntable or shelf context

## Art Style Recommendations

### Classic (Watercolor Sketch)

**Best for:** Characters, fantasy/RPG content, whimsical subjects, creative content
**Why:** Adds artistic charm, foreground colorful with sketchy background
**Example use cases:** D&D characters, fairy tales, whimsical recipes, creative writing prompts

### Modern (Clean Contemporary)

**Best for:** Food, products, educational content, business/productivity, fitness
**Why:** Professional, clean, adaptable to any subject type
**Example use cases:** Recipe cards, workout demonstrations, product catalogs, business frameworks

### Inked (Tattoo-Inspired Bold)

**Best for:** ANY content that deserves iconic, bold treatment - food, people, objects, concepts
**Why:** Graphic, two-dimensional, tattoo-worthy aesthetic with vibrant colors and strong lines
**Influences:** Traditional tattoo flash, Mexican folk art, street art murals, vintage clip art
**Key principle:** **INK ECONOMY FOR PRINT** - Neutral (white/empty) backgrounds ALWAYS
**Rationale:**

- Print-first design: saves ink, money, and the environment
- Empty backgrounds make subjects more iconic and powerful
- Think: clip art, tattoo flash sheets, screen printing on blank paper
- NEVER solid color fills (especially black) - wasteful and ink-hungry
- Optional subtle line work/etching if context absolutely needed
  **Example use cases:**
- Food ("This noodle bowl could totally be a tattoo!")
- Characters with attitude and energy
- Objects as iconic symbols
- Concepts as bold graphic metaphors
- Anything that should feel POWERFUL and MEMORABLE

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Do This)

### ❌ Text in Images

Never include recipe instructions, stat blocks, or written content in the image itself.

### ❌ Generic Character Portraits for Non-Characters

Don't force recipe cards to have a person cooking - show the food!
Don't force location cards to have a person visiting - show the place!

### ❌ Ingredient Lists as Images

A recipe card image should show the **finished dish**, not a list of ingredients.

### ❌ Over-Literalness

"Programming Design Patterns" doesn't need to show a programmer at a computer.
Use visual metaphors instead.

### ❌ Wrong Composition Style

- Food as portrait → Should be overhead/angled
- Locations as close-up → Should be establishing shot
- Objects as environmental → Should be product shot

### ❌ Solid Color or Filled Backgrounds (Inked Style)

For the "inked" style, NEVER use solid color backgrounds - they waste ink and money!

- ❌ Bad: Ramen bowl on solid black background (ink nightmare!)
- ❌ Bad: Ramen bowl with intricate patterns filling the entire background
- ❌ Bad: Any solid color fill behind the subject
- ✅ Good: Ramen bowl on completely neutral/white empty background
- ✅ Acceptable: Minimal subtle line work/etching if context requires
- **Why:** Print-first design means ink economy. Empty backgrounds save money, help the environment, and make the subject more iconic.
- Think: Clip art, tattoo flash sheets, screen prints - bold subject on blank paper

## Prompt Optimization Examples

### Example 1: Recipe Card

**Input:**

- Title: Aglio e Olio
- Description: Traditional Roman pasta dish with garlic and olive oil
- Stats: Pasta (g): 400, Garlic cloves: 4

**Bad optimization:**
"Ingredients on a counter: pasta, garlic, olive oil"

**Good optimization:**
"Food photography portrait orientation: steaming plate of spaghetti aglio e olio, golden garlic pieces visible, glossy olive oil coating, sprinkled with red pepper flakes and fresh parsley, rustic ceramic plate, warm lighting, overhead angle, appetizing presentation, no text visible"

### Example 2: Norwegian Celebrity Pokemon

**Input:**

- Title: Harald Eia
- Description: Comedian and science communicator
- Traits: Awkward Charm, Type: Electric/Comedian

**Good optimization:**
"Portrait orientation Pokemon-style artwork: middle-aged Norwegian man with friendly awkward smile, electric energy sparks around him, comedian personality, approachable but nerdy energy, Pokemon anime art style, colorful and dynamic, portrait composition, no text visible"

### Example 3: Workout Exercise

**Input:**

- Title: Push-Up (Standard)
- Description: Classic bodyweight exercise targeting chest, shoulders, triceps
- Stats: Intensity: 6, Duration: 30

**Good optimization:**
"Portrait orientation fitness demonstration: person in proper push-up form, body in straight plank position, hands shoulder-width, clean white background, clear view of proper technique, athletic wear, neutral lighting, professional fitness photography style, no text visible"

### Example 4: Recipe (Inked Style)

**Input:**

- Title: Spicy Ramen Bowl
- Description: Rich tonkotsu broth with perfectly cooked noodles
- Style: Inked

**Good optimization:**
"Portrait orientation tattoo-inspired bold artwork optimized for print: ramen bowl from overhead angle, thick black outlines defining noodles and bowl edge, vibrant colors (deep red chili oil, golden broth, green scallions), flat graphic style like traditional tattoo flash and clip art, bold simplified shapes, high contrast color blocking, Mexican folk art influence, street art energy, iconic composition, **completely neutral white empty background with NO color fill - pure negative space around the bowl**, zero background detail, focus all ink on the subject, clip art aesthetic, screen print on blank paper, THIS COULD BE A TATTOO, saves ink for printing, no text visible"

**Key insights:**

- The "inked" style transforms everyday objects (even food!) into iconic, tattoo-worthy graphic art
- **Print-first ink economy:** Neutral (empty) background ALWAYS - saves ink, money, and environment
- NEVER solid color backgrounds - wasteful and unnecessary
- Optional: minimal etching/line work if context absolutely required
- Like traditional tattoo flash sheets and clip art: bold subject on blank paper

## Summary

**Key principle:** Let the content type determine the composition style.

- People → portrait
- Food → overhead/angled
- Objects → product shot
- Places → establishing shot
- Concepts → metaphorical

The image generation system should adapt intelligently based on the card's actual content, not force everything into a "character portrait" mold.
