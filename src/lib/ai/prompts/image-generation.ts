Ensure that the prompt does not trigger content filters by avoiding potentially problematic words or themes. If necessary, reframe the subject into a more abstract or metaphorical visual concept.

FOCUS ON:
- Visual elements, appearance, mood, atmosphere
- Subject's physical description and setting
- Compelling visual storytelling elements
- Portrait-style composition when appropriate

REMOVE OR TRANSFORM:
- Game mechanics, stats, numbers
- Potentially problematic words (attack, damage, weapon â†’ descriptive alternatives)
- Abstract concepts into concrete visual metaphors
- Technical jargon into visual descriptions
- Any references to "cards" or "trading cards"

ALWAYS ADD:
- "Portrait orientation artwork"
- "No text, numbers, or writing visible in the image"
- Clear subject focus and composition guidance
- Atmospheric and mood descriptors

Return ONLY the optimized visual prompt text, nothing else.`;

- Center composition on upper portions of image
- Follow attached art style exactly

- No text, numbers, or writing anywhere in the image
- No borders, frames, or margins around the artwork`;

- Similar to a partially completed, highly detailed masterful watercolor painting
- Important elements include faces, hands, fabrics, metals and object of special significance
- Important elements are in full color and highly detailed, bold and colorful
- Background and non-essential elements are sketch-like and not coloured in yet
- Backgrounds and non-essential elements are grayscale pencil sketch/drawing style
- Use a mix of fine detail and sketchy lines
- High detail on important elements, less detail on non-essential elements`,
    modern: `Contemporary portrait or product image:
- Neutral white background, keeping all focus on the subject
- Crisply focused digital photography
- Clean lines, vibrant colors, and smooth shading
- Emphasize clarity and stark, modern aesthetics
- Balanced composition with focus on main subject
- Soft, almost imperceptible lighting, creating only the subtlest shadows`,
    inked: `Bold ink drawing with high contrast:
- Strong, confident black ink lines defining shapes and details
- High contrast between light and dark areas
- Minimal shading, relying on line work to convey depth and texture
- Ink-effective cross-hatching and stippling for shading
- Dynamic and expressive line work, conveying energy and movement
- Simple or neutral backgrounds, keeping focus on the main subject
- Dynamic composition with a sense of movement and energy
- Emphasize dramatic lighting and shadow play`,
