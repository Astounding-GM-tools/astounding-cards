# Card Editor Development Roadmap

## 🎉 Current Status (Completed)

### ✅ Ultra-Compact Card Edit Dialog
- **Complete redesign** - No header, fieldset-style inputs, compact footer
- **Real card previews** - Uses actual Card components with live updates
- **Space efficient** - Both front/back cards visible without scrolling

## 🛠️ Technical Notes

### Current Architecture
- **Framework**: Svelte 5 with runes ($state, $derived, $effect)
- **Database**: IndexedDB with reactive store layer
- **Styling**: CSS with CSS custom properties
- **Components**: Modular card components (Header, StatFocus, etc.)

### Key Files
- `/src/routes/next/+page.svelte` - Main card view and dialog trigger
- `/src/lib/next/components/dialogs/CardEditDialog.svelte` - Edit dialog
- `/src/lib/next/stores/deckStore.svelte.ts` - Card data management
- `/src/lib/next/components/dialog/` - Dialog system
- `/src/lib/next/components/card/` - Card rendering components

### Development Workflow
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open: `http://localhost:5173/next`
3. Click any card to open edit dialog
4. Test changes in both card previews

### Next Session Quick Start
```bash
cd /Users/olemak/Projects/eksperimenter/char-cards
npm run dev
# Open browser to http://localhost:5173/next
# Click a card to test current dialog functionality
```
