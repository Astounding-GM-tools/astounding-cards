# Character Cards Usage Guide

## Overview
Character Cards is a flexible tool for creating, managing, and printing reference cards for RPG campaigns. While it started as a character management system, it works equally well for items, locations, and other campaign elements.

## Card Types and Their Stats

### Characters
- **Age** (when known) appears in top right corner
- Observable information on front
- Game stats and secrets on back

### Items
- **Portability** in top right corner indicates how easily an item can be transported or concealed
- Includes documents, artifacts, evidence, and other physical objects

#### Portability Categories
- **Negligible:** Can be palmed or slipped into a pocket (photos, documents, small evidence)
- **Light:** Pocketable but detectable on search (pistol, dagger, book)
- **Medium:** Designed to be carried but visible (sword, rifle, laptop)
- **Heavy:** Carryable but obvious/awkward (spear, chair, large chest)
- **Stationary:** Fixed in place or part of the scene (can be documented/recorded)

### Locations
- **Area** in top right corner shows where the location can be found
- Can reference either:
  - Another location card in the deck ("hard link")
  - A named area or district ("soft link")
- Examples:
  - "Secret Chamber" area: [Banker's Guild] (hard link to another card)
  - "Banker's Guild" area: "Bj√∏rvika" (soft link to district)
  - "Abandoned Warehouse" area: "The Docks" (soft link)

## Card Structure
Each card has two sides:
- **Front:** Observable information that players can see
- **Back:** GM-only information (stats, secrets, notes)

For player handouts, print only the front sides (odd-numbered pages), leaving the backs blank for player notes.

## Usage Tips
1. **Front Card Information**
   - Keep to observable facts
   - Use traits for notable features
   - Include appropriate stat for card type:
     - Characters: Age (if known)
     - Items: Portability
     - Locations: Area
   - Use traits for other relationships/states

2. **Back Card Information**
   - Game stats and mechanics
   - Hidden information
   - GM notes and hooks
   - Secret relationships

3. **Location Areas**
   - Use hard links (other cards) for significant contained locations
   - Use soft links (text) for districts and general areas
   - Keep area names evocative and setting-appropriate
   - Areas are optional but help organize related locations

4. **Player Handouts**
   - Print odd-numbered pages only
   - Players get front information
   - Blank backs for their notes
   - Perfect for investigation handouts

5. **GM Reference**
   - Print all pages
   - Complete information
   - Quick reference during play
   - Easy secret management
