# Card Deck Creator Usage Guide

## Overview
Card Deck Creator is a flexible tool for creating, managing, and printing reference cards for RPG campaigns. It works equally well for characters, items, locations, and other campaign elements.

## Card Types and Their Stats

### Characters
- **Age** (when known) appears in top right corner
- Observable information on front
- Game stats and secrets on back

### Items
- **Portability** in top right corner indicates how easily an item can be transported or concealed
- Includes documents, artifacts, evidence, and other physical objects

#### Portability Categories
- **Negligible:** Can be palmed or slipped into a pocket (photos, documents, small evidence)
- **Light:** Pocketable but detectable on search (pistol, dagger, book)
- **Medium:** Designed to be carried but visible (sword, rifle, laptop)
- **Heavy:** Carryable but obvious/awkward (spear, chair, large chest)
- **Stationary:** Fixed in place or part of the scene (can be documented/recorded)

### Locations
- **Area** in top right corner shows where the location can be found
- Can reference either:
  - Another location card in the deck ("hard link")
  - A named area or district ("soft link")
- Examples:
  - "Secret Chamber" area: [Banker's Guild] (hard link to another card)
  - "Banker's Guild" area: "Bjørvika" (soft link to district)
  - "Abandoned Warehouse" area: "The Docks" (soft link)

## Card Structure
Each card has two sides:
- **Front:** Observable information that players can see
- **Back:** GM-only information (stats, secrets, notes)

For player handouts, print only the front sides (odd-numbered pages), leaving the backs blank for player notes.

## Usage Tips
1. **Front Card Information**
   - Keep to observable facts
   - Use traits for notable features
   - Include appropriate stat for card type:
     - Characters: Age (if known)
     - Items: Portability
     - Locations: Area
   - Use traits for other relationships/states

2. **Back Card Information**
   - Game stats and mechanics
   - Hidden information
   - GM notes and hooks
   - Secret relationships

3. **Location Areas**
   - Use hard links (other cards) for significant contained locations
   - Use soft links (text) for districts and general areas
   - Keep area names evocative and setting-appropriate
   - Areas are optional but help organize related locations

4. **Player Handouts**
   - Print odd-numbered pages only
   - Players get front information
   - Blank backs for their notes
   - Perfect for investigation handouts

5. **GM Reference**
   - Print all pages
   - Complete information
   - Quick reference during play
   - Easy secret management

## Image Handling

### Portrait Images
Each card can have a portrait image that appears on the front. Images are:
- Automatically scaled and center-cropped to fit
- Converted to WebP format for efficiency
- Stored locally for offline use
- Optimized for common AI art dimensions (1024px width)

### Adding Images
You can add images in two ways:
1. **Local Files**
   - Select an image file from your device
   - Image is processed and stored locally
   - Perfect for offline use
   - Best for AI-generated art or prepared images

2. **Image URLs**
   - Paste a URL to an online image
   - Image is downloaded, processed, and stored locally
   - Original URL is preserved for sharing
   - Good for web-sourced images

### Image Tips
- **Recommended Size:** 1024×1434 pixels (5:7 ratio)
- **Preparation:** Pre-crop images if specific positioning is needed
- **Sources:**
  - AI art generators (Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.)
  - Stock photos
  - Personal artwork
  - Campaign artwork
- **Sharing:**
  - URLs are preferred for sharing decks (smaller file size)
  - Local images are included as data when sharing (larger file size)
  - Warning shown when shared deck size is large
  - Consider using image URLs for large decks
