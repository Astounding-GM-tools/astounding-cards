# Character Cards Usage Guide

## Overview
Character Cards is a flexible tool for creating, managing, and printing reference cards for RPG campaigns. While it started as a character management system, it works equally well for items, locations, clues, and other campaign elements.

## Card Structure
Each card has two sides:
- **Front:** Observable information that players can see
- **Back:** GM-only information (stats, secrets, notes)

For player handouts, print only the front sides (odd-numbered pages), leaving the backs blank for player notes.

## Card Types
- Characters (NPCs, allies, adversaries)
- Items (artifacts, weapons, evidence)
- Locations (buildings, rooms, scenes)
- Handouts (documents, photos, clues)

## Portability Categories
Items, evidence, and artifacts use a portability system that reflects how they can be handled and concealed in the narrative:

### Negligible
- Can be palmed or slipped into a pocket
- Easily hidden or transported
- Examples: photos, documents, small evidence samples, USB drives
- Note: Many stationary items can be converted to negligible through documentation

### Light
- Pocketable but detectable on search
- Can be concealed but might be found
- Examples: pistol, dagger, book, small lockbox
- Think: "Would a pat-down reveal this?"

### Medium
- Designed to be carried but visible
- Can be "concealed" but obviously carrying something
- Examples: sword, rifle, laptop, large tome
- Note: Might be concealed in containers but still obvious (rifle in guitar case)
- Converting between concealed/usable states takes time

### Heavy
- Carryable but obvious/awkward
- Cannot be effectively concealed
- Examples: spear, chair, large chest, evidence boards
- Think: "You can move it, but everyone will notice"

### Stationary
- Fixed in place or part of the scene
- Can be documented/recorded
- Examples: crime scenes, wall markings, building features
- Note: Can often create negligible versions through photos/notes

## Usage Tips
1. **Front Card Information**
   - Keep to observable facts
   - Use traits for notable features
   - Include portability for relevant items
   - Age for characters (when known)

2. **Back Card Information**
   - Game stats and mechanics
   - Hidden information
   - GM notes and hooks
   - Secret relationships

3. **Player Handouts**
   - Print odd-numbered pages only
   - Players get front information
   - Blank backs for their notes
   - Perfect for investigation handouts

4. **GM Reference**
   - Print all pages
   - Complete information
   - Quick reference during play
   - Easy secret management
